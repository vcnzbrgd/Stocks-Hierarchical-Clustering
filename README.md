# Stocks' Hierarchical Clustering

Goal of this project is to replicate the stocks' hierarchical clustering proposed in the paper "Hierarchical Structure in Financial Markets" by Mantegna (1998).
The idea outlined in Mantegnaâ€™s work is to create a taxonomy using a metric based solely on the
information provided by the time-series of stock prices. He demonstrates that the obtained unsupervised clustering
reflects an aggregation somewhat similar to the one achievable labelling stocks by sector.

The steps of the process are:
- Create a Distance matrix $D$ from the matrix of pairwise stocks correlation $\rho_{i,j}$. The distance between stock $i$ and stock $j$ is defined as: 

$$d(i,j) = \sqrt{2 \times (1- \rho_{i,j})}$$

- Compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on the Distance matrix $D$.

- Build an Ultrametric Distance $d'(i,j)$ starting from $d(i,j)$. The Ultrametric distance between $i$ and $j$ is defined as the maximum value among all the pairwise distances evaluated in the path that connects $i$ and $j$. For example:

$$d'(A,G)=max(3,2,8,7,4,1,3)=8$$

The resulting Ultrametric Distance Matrix $D'$ can also serve as input for a portfolio construction approach that improves the traditional and unstable Mean-Variance optimization as shown in De Prado (2016).

The findings from applying hierarchical clustering to S&P 500 constituents are detailed in the file named "sp500_members_clustering.ipynb." The dendrogram effectively illustrates the formation of stock groupings that align with the similarities found within the banking sector, REITs, the healthcare/biotechnology industry, industrials and energy sector.
